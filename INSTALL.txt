Guide to installing pybb application.

The main point in development of pybb is to build it so it could be
*easly* integrated to existing django based site. This mean:

* pybb does not provide features like user registration, password restoring.
  It does not provide authentication page. You should use your favorite
  application for suck kind things. You can try well known django-registration
  http://code.google.com/p/django-registration/ or my own implementation 
  http://hg.pydev.ru/django-account. Both applications contain install instruction
  in the distributive.

* all pybb stuff placed in one application which is called pybb

* I'm trying to stay with KISS principe. At least in the begining of pybb 
  development. I mean that there are no threaded posts and there is only bbcode
  markup support and there is no multi-level nested categories.
