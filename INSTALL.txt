Guide to installing pybb application.

The main point in development of pybb is to build it so it could be
*easly* integrated to existing django based site. Before installing pybb
your should answer the question: do you want to stay with your own application
for registration/login/logout/password restoring or you want to use that is 
sheeped with pybb. Firstly let's talk about more easy variant:

Installing with pybb account module
===================================

* copy account and pybb directories to your project root
* copy static/pybb to your MEDIA root
* setup settings.py
  TODO: describe that should be placed to settings.py


Installing only pybb without account application
=================================================
If you want to use your own account application then you should add additional
entries to account application urlconfig. This step required becouse pybb use
url reversing with predefined names. For example "Registration" link in pybb 
template points to {% url registration_register %}

Damned English... I'm tired of this writing....
