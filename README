PyBB - is Django application which implements forum function, i.e., 
it allows users of your site to create discussion threads also known as topics.

PyBB is quite unstable. If some feture exists in rev.A then it could be
dropped in rev.B.

Current implementation does not have templates. You can find working set
of templates here: https://bitbucket.org/lorien/pep8/src/dddba1eb4931/templates/pybb/
