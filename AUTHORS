PyBB was originally created in late 2008.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

    * Grigoriy Petukhov <lorien@pyweb.ru>

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Django that much better:

    Zhukov Pavel <gelios@gmail.com>
    Nikolai Sevostjanov <nikolai.sevostjanov@gmail.com>
