PyBB was originally created in late 2008.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

    * Grigoriy Petukhov <lorien@lorien.name>

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made PyBB that much better:

    Zhukov Pavel <gelios@gmail.com>
    Nikolai Sevostjanov <nikolai.sevostjanov@gmail.com>
    Denis Burij <denger@footter.com>
    Alexander Solovyov <piranha@piranha.org.ua>
    William Grzybowski <william88@gmail.com>
    Nikolai Zamkovoi <nickzam@gmail.com>
